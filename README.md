A clone of the popular wordle game, with variable word length.
Currently includes 5 & 6-letter words.

Main Branch: standard game.

NodeJS branch: multiplayer game running on a nodeJS server, gives a new word after everyone has completed the previous one.

currently, the word checker doesn't work after adding different length words, not just 5 letters.
